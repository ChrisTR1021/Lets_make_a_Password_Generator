JavaScript: Password Generator

## Details

This is my Javascript Password Generator. I attempted to do the prompts a bit different by adding check boxes into the generator. The character count was set between 8-128 different charcaters, the counter does function and allows the number to be changed depending on the counter. It does function by clicking to the different checkbox options and which will input said character. The intial html code is generally the same as what was given, i only changed enough to add check boxes and widen the text area.
